changes:
  - rscadd: Replaces the bluespace drive placeholder with a proper machine, effects
      and sounds included.
  - rscadd: Adds the 'BSD Instability' Event, which causes spooky anomalies while
      its active, can trigger in the 'moderate' and 'major' categories.
  - tweak: The Torch will be removed from the overmap during jump.
  - tweak: If the drive is missing/destroyed, there will be no jump, round will simply
      end after the same amount of time.

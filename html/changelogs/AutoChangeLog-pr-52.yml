changes:
  - admin: Mentors can now be specified in adminranks.txt with the "+MENTOR" permission,
      or with "+EVERYTHING". Staff ranks that have ONLY +MENTOR will not receive the
      default admin verbs or access to the MC panel, and cannot deadmin themselves.
  - rscadd: All players now have access to a "Mentorhelp" verb, which allows you to
      request help from an in-game mentor similar to an adminhelp.
  - rscadd: Mentors can respond to a player's mentorhelp by clicking on their name
      (players can reply to a mentor in the same way) and can also initiate the conversation
      by either right-clicking a mob or in the "Mentor PM" verb.
  - admin: Msay has received an overhaul and now stands for mentorsay, not moderatorsay.
      Mentors have access to it by default. Admins retain access.
  - tweak: All of the verbs listed above, as well as adminhelp, asay, admin PM, and
      staffwho are now in a new "Staffhelp" category for easier access.
  - admin: Admin memos have been moved to an "Admin Memos" verb, and a new "Mentor
      Memos" verb has been added with nearly-identical functionality. They both reside
      in the Admin verb category. Mentors cannot edit or delete mentor memos or see
      admin memos.
  - admin: Mentor action logs (mentorhelps and PMs) can be viewed in the Secrets panel.
  - admin: Two new config settings have been added, LOG_MENTOR and ENABLE_MEMOS. The
      former acts similarly to LOG_ADMIN, and the latter will enable/disable the use
      of the memo systems (though the verbs will still be visible).
  - admin: Admins can mute people from using mentorhelps and mentor PMs.

changes:
  - tweak: Microwaves are no longer used to cook recipes. Instead, they're used to
      cook ingredient items, such as raw cutlets, in bulk.
  - tweak: Using monkey cubes in the worst way now also fractures your chest, in addition
      to having a beefier message and a splat sound.
  - rscadd: Added the electric stove, which is the new machine used to cook recipes.
      It cooks a bit faster than the microwave (to make up for there only being one
      of them) and can be upgraded with stock parts.
  - rscadd: Added an electric stove to the Torch galley and several offships.
  - rscadd: Added hot plates (smaller versions of the stove) to places that currently
      only have a microwave that now lack an object to cook food, including most of
      the other offships not mentioned above.
  - rscadd: Added baking sheets, which are large trays that can be put into stoves
      or hot plates while they have food on them to cook the ingredients on them as
      though they were standalone. For instance, you can put the ingredients for a
      taco onto a sheet, and the ingredients for meatbread into the stove, and both
      a taco and a loaf of meatbread will be cooked! They can only hold anything that
      could normally fit into a stove.
  - bugfix: Trays can no longer hold other trays, creating infinite tray recursion.

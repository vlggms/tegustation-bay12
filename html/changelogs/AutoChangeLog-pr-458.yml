  - rscadd: 'Added first catastrophe level event: Leviathan. As it exists in the overmap,
      it will slowly spawn infestation hives that act not much different from carp
      schools, except those will throw infestation mobs at you. To defeat it - you
      must fire 8 fire/explosive OFD charges. If you take too long(25 minutes) to
      kill it, the entire sector will be overrun.'
